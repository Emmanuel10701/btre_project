# Real Estate Project

## Overview
This is a full-stack real estate web application built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend, with Ailons CSS for styling. The platform allows users to browse, search, and filter real estate listings, providing an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Technologies Used
### Backend (Django)
- Django REST Framework (DRF) for API development
- PostgreSQL/MySQL for the database
- Django authentication system
- Django CORS Headers for cross-origin requests

### Frontend (React)
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API requests
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management
- Context API for global state management

### Styling (Ailons CSS)
- Predefined components for a clean UI
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Custom styling overrides for a unique look

## Features Implemented

- **User Authentication:** Login, registration, and JWT-based authentication
- **Property Listings:** CRUD operations for property management
- **Filtering & Sorting:** API endpoints to filter properties based on price, location, and type
- **Search Functionality:** Full-text search for property listings
- **Image Uploads:** Support for uploading property images
- **Favorites System:** Users can save their favorite listings

### Frontend Features
